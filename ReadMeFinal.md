Prerequisites:
MySQL must be installed on your local machine.
Access to the .sql file containing the database dump.
Appropriate MySQL privileges to create and modify databases on your local machine.
Steps to Replicate the Database Locally:
Install MySQL:

Ensure that MySQL is installed on your machine:
Windows: Download and install using MySQL Installer.
macOS: Install via Homebrew:
bash
Copy code
brew install mysql
Linux (Ubuntu): Install via terminal:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mysql-server
Modify Connection Details:

Update the database connection settings in the code to use localhost instead of the whitelisted IP.
Host: localhost
User, Password, Database: Enter your local MySQL credentials here.
Create Local Database:

Open a terminal/command prompt and log into MySQL:
bash
Copy code
mysql -u root -p
Create a new database:
sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE partbjob_local;
Import SQL File:

Navigate to the folder where the .sql file is stored and run the following command:
bash
Copy code
mysql -u root -p partbjob_local < file.sql
Replace partbjob_local with your database name and file.sql with the name of your .sql file.
Verify the Import:

Check the imported tables by running:
bash
Copy code
mysql -u root -p
USE partbjob_local;
SHOW TABLES;
Ensure that the necessary tables are imported and data is in place.
Installing Packages
1. Install Python Packages:
Ensure you have Python and pip installed on your machine. Run the following command to install the required dependencies from the requirements.txt file:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the Flask Application:
After the dependencies are installed, you can run the Flask application using the following command:
bash
Copy code
python -m flask run
This will start the Flask development server, and you can access the application in your browser at http://localhost:5000.
Project Overview
The PartBJob application is a web-based platform designed to connect students with employers, allowing them to create personalized profiles that list their academic background, skills, and work experience. Employers can search for students with specific skills and post job opportunities. The goal of this project is to bring the MVP to life by delivering essential features such as job searches and profile management for both students and employers.

Objectives:
Provide students with a platform to showcase their skills and academic background for job opportunities.
Provide employers with a platform to search for students with the required skills and academic background to bring young talent into their business.
Lay the foundation for scalability in future iterations of the platform.
Application Architecture
The architecture of the application consists of three layers:

Front-end: Built using React.js, the front-end handles user interactions like creating profiles and searching for jobs. It communicates with the back-end API to dynamically update the content without needing to refresh the page.
Back-end: The back-end, built with Node.js and Express.js, handles business logic, user authentication, and communicates with the PostgreSQL database. It processes user requests and updates job postings and profiles accordingly.
Database: PostgreSQL is used to store student and employer profiles, job postings, and application data. The database ensures secure and organized data management.
The Flow of Data:
Users (students and employers) interact with the front-end, which sends requests to the back-end.
The back-end processes these requests and communicates with the PostgreSQL database to retrieve or modify data.
The back-end then sends the necessary data back to the front-end, which dynamically renders it using React components.
Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
User: Stores data for both students and employers, including names and contact information.
StudentProfile: Linked to a User, containing academic history, work experience, skills, and an optional profile photo.
EmployerProfile: Linked to a User, containing company details and job postings.
JobPosting: Contains job-related information such as job title, description, and associated employer.
Application: Links students to job postings and tracks which students have applied to which jobs.
Future Considerations for Scaling
The PartBJob application was designed with scalability in mind. Here are some ideas for future scaling:

Horizontal Scaling: Using Heroku, additional server instances can be added to handle increased traffic.
Database Scaling: PostgreSQL can be optimized through indexing, partitioning, and replication to efficiently manage larger quantities of data.
Microservices Architecture: As new features are added, the application could be split into microservices for easier management and scalability.
Legal, Ethical, and GDPR Considerations
Data Protection: The application adheres to GDPR guidelines, securely storing user data in the database and allowing users to delete their data if requested.
Ethical Use: The platform is designed to provide equal job opportunities to all users, regardless of their background.
Risk Assessment:
Data Breaches: Regular security updates and audits will help prevent potential vulnerabilities.
Operational Downtime: Heroku ensures high availability through automated backups and redundancy.
Compliance: All user data is handled in compliance with GDPR regulations, ensuring user privacy and data security.
Technology Stack
Back-end: Node.js & Express.js

Why Node.js with Express?: Node.js allows for fast and scalable web applications, while Express simplifies HTTP requests, API creation, and routing. This combination is ideal for handling large amounts of data and making the project structure easy to manage.
Front-end: React.js

Why React?: React is perfect for building single-page applications (SPAs), offering fast rendering times and a dynamic user experience. It simplifies state management through hooks like useState and useEffect.
Database: PostgreSQL

Why PostgreSQL?: PostgreSQL is a powerful relational database system that supports complex queries and JSON data, ensuring data integrity and efficient handling of job searches.
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

Why JWT?: JWT offers a secure token format for session management and authentication, ensuring that only authenticated users can access sensitive endpoints.
Deployment: Heroku

Why Heroku?: Heroku provides simple and scalable deployment, integrated with PostgreSQL, allowing for easy future scaling.
Project Plan & Milestones
Semester 1: UI Development
Week 1-3: Research and selection of front-end and back-end technologies.
Week 4-6: Initial development of the user interface with mock data for students and employers.
Week 7-9: Profile creation and login functionality.
Week 10-12: Secure login/registration and initial testing.
Semester 2: Back-end and Database Integration
Week 1-3: Set up PostgreSQL and define relationships between users, jobs, and applications.
Week 4-6: Develop RESTful APIs for profile updates, job postings, and job searches.
Week 7-9: Integrate the front-end with the back-end, focusing on dynamic data.
Week 10-12: Final testing and security enhancements.
Ethical & Cultural Considerations
User Privacy: Privacy-by-design principles were implemented to protect user data.
Inclusivity: The interface was designed to be culturally neutral and accessible to all demographics.
Non-Discriminatory Practices: Job listings and content are reviewed to ensure they are free from biased or discriminatory language.
MVP Status and Challenges
Despite significant progress on key MVP features, some aspects are incomplete. Below is a justification for the delays:

Semester 1 Challenges:
At the beginning of semester 1, a last-minute decision to switch universities and relocate created logistical challenges. This required prioritizing discussions with SFE and DSA for financing, which impacted the ability to focus on the project.

Semester 2 Challenges:
During semester 2, health-related issues, including surgery, required significant time for recovery. This resulted in the delay of some project features as well-being took precedence.
